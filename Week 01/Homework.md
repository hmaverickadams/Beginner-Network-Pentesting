# Week 1 Homework

Howdy Mentees,

Tomorrow starts our journey into pentesting.  As a reminder, we will be starting at 8PM EST on https://www.twitch.tv/thecybermentor.

Here is the agenda:

-Course Overview (15-20 minutes)

-Setting Up A Penetration Testing Environment (15-20 minutes)

-A Lesson on Notekeeping (15-20 minutes)

-Introductory Linux (1 hour)

-Q&A / AMA

Prior to the course starting, you will need a few things downloaded (and installed):

1) Your favorite VM software.  I will be using VMWare Pro throughout the course, but you can use VMWare Workstation Player for free.  Here is a link to that: https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html

2) Kali Linux.  Please download the correct image based on your VM software here (note: you'll need a torrent client to download): https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/

3) Your favorite notekeeping software.  Personally, I like KeepNote, which comes built into Kali.  However, I like using the Windows version a bit more.  You can find that here: http://keepnote.org/.  Alternative software includes CherryTree and Atom, but I will be demonstrating KeepNote this week.

Other than that, just bring your happy faces this week!  I look forward to seeing you all tomorrow :)
